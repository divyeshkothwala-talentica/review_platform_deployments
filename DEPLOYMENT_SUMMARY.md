### 🏗️ Infrastructure Components

**AWS Resources Created by Terraform:**
- **VPC** with custom networking (10.0.0.0/16)
- **EC2 Instance** (t3.medium) with Amazon Linux 2023
- **Security Groups** with ports 22, 5000, 5001, 27017
- **Elastic IP** for stable public access
- **S3 Bucket** for deployment artifacts
- **IAM Roles** for EC2 and GitHub Actions
- **CloudWatch Log Groups** for monitoring

**Software Automatically Installed:**
- **Node.js 18.x** (latest LTS)
- **MongoDB 7.0** (latest stable)
- **PM2** for process management
- **CloudWatch Agent** for monitoring
- **AWS CLI** for S3 operations

### 🔧 Key Features

1. **Production-Ready Environment**
   - Node.js 18+ for optimal performance
   - MongoDB 7.0 with automatic startup
   - PM2 process management with clustering
   - CloudWatch monitoring and logging

2. **Automated Deployment**
   - GitHub Actions CI/CD pipelines
   - Terraform infrastructure as code
   - Automated application deployment
   - Database migration scripts

3. **Security & Monitoring**
   - IAM roles with minimal permissions
   - Security groups with restricted access
   - SSH key management
   - Health checks and monitoring

4. **Database Management**
   - Automated MongoDB installation
   - Data migration from local to EC2
   - Backup and restore scripts
   - Health monitoring

## 🚀 Quick Deployment Steps

### 1. Generate SSH Keys
```bash
cd /Users/divyeshk/learning/deployment/terraform/scripts
chmod +x generate-ssh-keys.sh
./generate-ssh-keys.sh
```

### 2. Configure GitHub Secrets
Add these secrets to your GitHub repository:
- `AWS_ROLE_ARN` - Your AWS IAM role ARN
- `TF_STATE_BUCKET` - Terraform state bucket name
- `SSH_PUBLIC_KEY` - Generated public key
- `SSH_PRIVATE_KEY` - Generated private key
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` - Your OpenAI API key (already provided)
- `JWT_SECRET` - JWT secret for authentication

### 3. Deploy Infrastructure
**Option A: GitHub Actions (Recommended)**
1. Go to your repository's Actions tab
2. Run "Backend Infrastructure Deployment"
3. Select "apply" and "production"

**Option B: Manual Deployment**
```bash
cd /Users/divyeshk/learning/deployment/terraform
terraform init
terraform plan -var-file=backend.tfvars
terraform apply -var-file=backend.tfvars
```

### 4. Deploy Application
Run "Backend Application Deployment" workflow or use manual deployment scripts.

### 5. Migrate Database
```bash
cd /Users/divyeshk/learning/deployment/terraform/scripts
./mongodb-migration.sh migrate <EC2_IP> ~/.ssh/review-platform-backend
```

### 6. Test Deployment
```bash
cd /Users/divyeshk/learning/deployment/scripts
./test-backend-apis.sh http://<EC2_IP>:5000
```

## 📋 Configuration Details

### Environment Variables (Automatically Configured)
```env
PORT=5000
NODE_ENV=production
CORS_ORIGIN=https://d157ilt95f9lq6.cloudfront.net
JWT_SECRET=<your-secret>
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/book_review_platform
OPENAI_API_KEY=<your-key>
```

### Application Structure on EC2
```
/opt/backend-app/
├── current/              # Current deployment
├── logs/                 # Application logs
├── backups/              # Database backups
├── .env                  # Environment configuration
├── ecosystem.config.js   # PM2 configuration
├── deploy.sh            # Deployment script
├── backup-mongodb.sh    # Database backup
└── restore-mongodb.sh   # Database restore
```

## 🔍 Monitoring & Health Checks

### Health Endpoints
- `GET /health` - Basic health check
- `GET /health/ready` - Readiness probe
- `GET /health/live` - Liveness probe

### Monitoring Locations
- **CloudWatch Logs**: `/aws/ec2/review-platform-backend`
- **Application Logs**: `/opt/backend-app/logs/`
- **MongoDB Logs**: `/var/log/mongodb/mongod.log`

### Useful Commands
```bash
# SSH to instance
ssh -i ~/.ssh/review-platform-backend ec2-user@<EC2_IP>

# Check application status
sudo -u backend-user pm2 list

# View logs
sudo tail -f /opt/backend-app/logs/combined.log

# Restart application
sudo systemctl restart backend-app
```

## 🧪 API Testing

The comprehensive API testing script tests all endpoints:
- Health and system endpoints
- Authentication (register/login)
- Books API (search, filtering, pagination)
- Reviews API (CRUD operations)
- Favorites API (add/remove/list)
- Recommendations API (AI-powered)
- User profile management
- Error handling and edge cases

## 🔒 Security Features

- **Network Security**: VPC with security groups
- **Access Control**: IAM roles with minimal permissions
- **SSH Security**: Key-based authentication only
- **Application Security**: JWT tokens, input validation
- **Data Security**: MongoDB access restricted to VPC

## 📊 What You Get After Deployment

1. **Stable Backend API** at `http://<EC2_IP>:5000`
2. **All Endpoints Working** with your existing frontend
3. **Database Migrated** with all your local data
4. **Monitoring Setup** with CloudWatch
5. **Backup Strategy** for database
6. **CI/CD Pipelines** for future deployments

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Deploy the Infrastructure**: Use the GitHub Actions workflow or manual Terraform commands
2. **Migrate Your Database**: Run the migration script to copy your local data
3. **Test All APIs**: Use the comprehensive testing script
4. **Update Frontend**: Point your frontend to the new backend URL
5. **Monitor**: Check CloudWatch logs and application health

## 📞 Support & Troubleshooting

### Common Issues & Solutions

**Application Not Starting:**
```bash
# Check PM2 status
sudo -u backend-user pm2 logs

# Restart application
sudo systemctl restart backend-app
```

**Database Issues:**
```bash
# Check MongoDB status
sudo systemctl status mongod

# Restart MongoDB
sudo systemctl restart mongod
```

**Network Issues:**
```bash
# Test connectivity
curl http://<EC2_IP>:5000/health

# Check security groups in AWS console
```

### Getting Help
- Check the comprehensive deployment guide: `BACKEND_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md`
